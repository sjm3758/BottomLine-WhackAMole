# BottomLine-WhackAMole
A Whack-A-Mole browser game made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Canvas tools.

The rules of this game are simple: the player chooses their level of difficulty, clicks on appearing "moles" (toilet paper rolls for the
theme," and is shown their score for the game as well as their highest score so far in the end. The player can retry the game as many
times as they want on the Game Over screen, as well as reset the game during play.

The timer is set to 20 seconds per game. Moles will spawn on a 1 second interval at first, but an additional mole is spawned every half
second after the time decreases by half. Depending on the difficulty players choose, moles will remain on screen either for a longer
or shorter period of time. There are additional comments in the code to explain the purpose of variables and functions.

The game was designed using primarily Javascript utilizing Canvas tools to manipulate text and images. It has been tested on most modern
browsers including Internet Explorer 11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. The canvas is small enough that the game can be played from a windowed
perspective as well.
